INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

angicart depends on ocaml and several other open-source unix utilities.  These
instructions are written with Linux and Mac OS in mind, but an intrepid person
may be able to adapt them to windows.  Lines beginning with $ are meant to be
typed at the command-line (Terminal) without the $.  Lines beginning with # are
meant to be typed at a root shell.  If you need help, please contact the
author.

1. Obtain and install git.

Use whatever method works for you.  General instructions can be found at
  http://git-scm.com/download

If you have Debian stable:
  # apt-get install git
If you have macports:
  $ sudo port install git-core

2. Obtain and install ocaml and ocaml packages.

GODI and OPAM are both package managers for ocaml software that contain all angicart's dependancies.

To install GODI, follow the instructions on the GODI installation page,
  http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/get_godi.html
To install OPAM, see http://opam.ocaml.org/

The library dependancies of angicart are, in GODI:
  godi-batteries, godi-pcre, godi-sdl, and godi-lablgl.
and in OPAM:
  batteries, pcre, lablgl, and ocamlsdl

3. Obtain angicart and run it

Get angicart; this will create a directory called angicart in the current
directory.
  $ git clone git@github.com:mnewberry/angicart.git

Enter that directory
  $ cd angicart

Run the graphdisplay program to see if everything works.
  $ ./make.sh graphdisplay run --help

If you see the help screen (and not an error), then everything is working fine.

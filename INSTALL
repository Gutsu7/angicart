INSTALLATION

Angicart depends on ocaml and other open-source unix utilities,
and is known to work on most Linux distributions and on OS X.
Lines beginning with $ are meant to be typed at the command-line
(Terminal) without the $.  Lines beginning with # are meant to
be typed at a root shell.  If you need help, please contact the
author.

1. Obtain and install git.  General instructions can be found at
http://git-scm.com/download

2. Install system dependencies using your OS package manager. On
OS X, homebrew is a package manager for Unix software, available
at http://brew.sh/ .

Once homebrew is working, angicart's system dependencies can be
installed as:

  $ brew install pcre sdl sdl_image

3. Obtain and install ocaml and ocaml packages.  Angicart is
known to work with recent versions of OPAM.  To install OPAM,
see http://opam.ocaml.org/ .  The library dependancies of
angicart are provided by OPAM packages. Once OPAM and the system
dependencies are installed:
 
  $ opam install batteries pcre lablgl ocamlsdl ounit

4. Obtain angicart and run it.  The following command  will
create a directory called angicart in the current directory:

  $ git clone https://github.com/mnewberry/angicart.git

Enter that directory

  $ cd angicart

Run the graphdisplay program to see if everything works.

  $ ./make.sh graphdisplay run --help

If you see the help screen (and not an error), then everything
is working.

EXAMPLE

On Mac OS X 10.10.3 with homebrew installed, ocaml, opam, and angicart can be
installedwith the following commands:

  $ git clone https://github.com/mnewberry/angicart.git
  $ brew install ocaml opam pcre sdl sdl_image
  $ opam init
  $ eval `opam config env`
  $ opam install batteries pcre lablgl ocamlsdl ounit
  $ cd angicart
  $ ./make.sh graphdisplay run --help
